## 📌 Overview

**Spot** is a full-stack, production-grade event management SaaS application that reimagines how events are created, discovered, and managed. At its core, Spot uses **Google Gemini AI** to generate complete event details from a single line of text - making event creation effortless for organizers of all kinds.

From personalized discovery feeds and QR-code-based ticketing to real-time dashboards and seamless attendee check-ins, Spot is built to handle the entire event lifecycle end-to-end.

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 AI-Powered Event Creation
Type a single prompt and watch Spot auto-generate a complete event — title, description, category, capacity, ticket type, pricing, and more — using the **Google Gemini API**. You can then review, edit, and publish in seconds.

### 🎯 Personalized Event Discovery
New users go through a guided onboarding flow where they select their **interests** and **location**. The explore page then curates:
- Featured events (carousel)
- Events near you (local)
- Events by category
- Popular events nationwide

### 🔐 Authentication & User Management
Powered by **Clerk**, Spot handles:
- Secure sign-in and sign-up flows
- Protected routes via middleware
- User profile management
- Dark mode preference

### 🎟️ QR Code Ticketing System
Each registered attendee receives a **unique QR-coded ticket**. Organizers can scan these at the venue using the built-in camera scanner (powered by `html5-qrcode`) or enter codes manually for check-in.

### 📊 Real-Time Organizer Dashboard
Organizers get a powerful dashboard with live data (via Convex):
- Total registrations & check-in count
- Revenue earned
- Check-in rate percentage
- Time remaining to event
- Attendee list with search and tab filtering (All / Checked-in / Pending)
- CSV export of all registrations

### 💳 Subscription Plans (Free & Pro)
Billing is handled through **Clerk Billing**:

| Feature | Free | Pro |
|---|---|---|
| Events you can create | 1 | Unlimited |
| AI event generation | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom event theme colors | ❌ | ✅ |
| QR ticketing & check-in | ✅ | ✅ |
| Analytics dashboard | ✅ | ✅ |

### 🖼️ Cover Image via Unsplash
A beautiful image picker powered by the **Unsplash API** is integrated into event creation, letting organizers search and select high-quality cover photos without leaving the app.

### 🔍 Search & Location Filtering
A debounced search bar and location selector (state + city) let users find exactly what they're looking for. Powered by the `country-state-city` npm package.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- A [Convex](https://convex.dev/) account
- A [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/) account
- Google Gemini API key
- Unsplash API access key

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Saket22-CS/Ai_Event_Organizer.git
cd spot-event-platform
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root:

```env
# Clerk
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up

# Convex
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_deployment_url

# Google Gemini
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Unsplash
NEXT_PUBLIC_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your_unsplash_access_key
```

### 4. Initialize Convex

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will set up your Convex backend and push the schema automatically.

### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

---

## ☁️ Deployment

### Vercel (Frontend)

1. Push your code to GitHub.
2. Import the repository in [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
3. Add all environment variables from `.env.local` in the Vercel dashboard.
4. Deploy - Vercel auto-detects Next.js and configures the build.

### Convex (Backend)

```bash
npx convex deploy
```

This pushes your schema and functions to Convex's production environment. Update your `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` in Vercel to point to the production deployment URL.

## 📱 Key User Flows

### For Attendees
1. **Sign up** → Complete **onboarding** (pick interests + location)
2. **Explore** personalized events → View event details
3. **Register** for an event → Receive a **QR-coded ticket**
4. View tickets in **My Tickets** → Show QR at the venue

### For Organizers
1. **Create an event** — manually or via **AI prompt**
2. Pick a cover image from **Unsplash**
3. Share the event link with attendees
4. **Dashboard** — track registrations, check-in attendees via **QR scanner**, export CSV

---

## 🧠 AI Event Generation

The AI creation flow is powered by **Google Gemini**. Here's how it works:

1. The user types a prompt (e.g., *"Tech networking night in San Francisco for startup founders"*)
2. The frontend sends the prompt to `/api/generate-event`
3. The Next.js API route calls Gemini with a structured system prompt requesting JSON output
4. The response is parsed and injected directly into the event creation form
5. The user reviews and adjusts before publishing

---
